VARIABLES
---------

  pts
    The list of values to act as the coordinates of the vector

CONSTRUCTOR
--------

(pts):
  Creates the vector with pts being the list of coordinates

FUNCITONS
--------

  Add(self, vect):
    Adds each component of vect to the current vector

  Subtract(vect):
    Subtracts each component of vect from the current vector

  Scalar_Mult(scalar):
    Multiplies each component of the vector by a scalar value

  Dot(vect):
    Performs the dot product operation of the vector, x1*x2 + y1*y2 + ...
  Length():
    Returns the length of the vector

  Equals(self, v2):
    Determines if the vectors are equal to a precision of 0.001

  Normalize(self):
    Scales the vector so that its length is equal to 1

  Distance(self, v2):
    Returns the distance between the two points represented by the vectors
